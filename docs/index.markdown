## What Is It?

This app is an example application of a **deep research agent** designed to collect comprehensive information about publicly-traded companies and generate detailed investment research reports. The target user would be a financial analyst or investor.

## About

This application leverages AI to perform automated financial research and analysis. It gathers data from multiple reliable financial sources to create structured investment reports with:

- Basic stock information and metrics
- Business overviews and revenue analysis
- Recent news and market events
- Financial performance summaries
- Risk and opportunity assessments
- Investor sentiment analysis

The application is built using [mcp-agent](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent){:target="mcp-agent"}, a framework for creating AI agents with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

We also want to demonstrate techniques for testing AI-enabled applications, where model outputs are not _deterministic_, i.e., 100% predictable for a given set of inputs. Developers are accustomed to testing deterministic components and applications, but AI experts have the techniques developers can use to be _confident_ their AI-enabled application works as designed. See [Achieving Confidence in Enterprise AI Applications](https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/ai-application-testing/){:target="_blank"} for more on this topic.

## Try It!
