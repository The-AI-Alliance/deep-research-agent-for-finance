# README for the `examples`

This folder contains example files, such as output for runs of the finance and medical applications.

The `gpt-oss_20b` folder contains outputs generated using `gpt-oss:20b`, served by a local `ollama` server, for both applications.

We plan to add examples to an `openai` folder with outputs generated using `gpt-4o` for the orchestration model and `o4-mini` for the Excel report generation.
