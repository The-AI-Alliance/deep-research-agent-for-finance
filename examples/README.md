# README for the `examples`

This folder contains example output files for runs analyzing META, which were written to `output/META`, then copied here.

The `gpt-oss_20b` folder contains outputs generated using `gpt-oss:20b` for both models, served by a local `ollama` server.

We plan to add examples to an `openai` folder with outputs generated using `gpt-4o` for the orchestration model and `o4-mini` for the Excel report generation.
